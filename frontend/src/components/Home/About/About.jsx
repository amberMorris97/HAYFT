      <p style={{ color: 'black', width: '75%' }} className="openSans about-para">I have have spent my career developing corporate DEI strategies anchored in social justice foundations. As the first Head of DEI (CDO) at W.L. Gore &amp; Associates (www.gore.com) I developed a philosophy and strategy that built on Goreâ€™s humanistic values and innovative business model. Relying on culture change and social movement methodologies, I was able to galvanize the involvement of thousands of Associates from around the world. Using curiosity and conversation, I helped teams deepen their understanding of identity differences and commit to disrupting bias in day-to-day life. With a strong focus on systems and structures, my approach is rooted in my belief that empathy and dialogue can solve most things.</p>
